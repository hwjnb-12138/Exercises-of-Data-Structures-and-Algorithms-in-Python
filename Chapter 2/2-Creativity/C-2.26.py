# The SequenceIterator class of Section 2.3.4 provides what is known as a
#  forward iterator. Implement a class named ReversedSequenceIterator that
#  serves as a reverse iterator for any Python sequence type. The first call to
#  next should return the last element of the sequence, the second call to next
#  should return the second-to-last element, and so forth.
