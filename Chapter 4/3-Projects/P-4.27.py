# Pythonâ€™s os module provides a function with signature walk(path) that
#  is a generator yielding the tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) for each
#  subdirectory of the directory identified by string path, such that string
#  dirpath is the full path to the subdirectory, dirnames is a list of the names
#  of the subdirectories within dirpath,and filenames is a list of the names
#  of non-directory entries of dirpath. For example, when visiting the cs016
#  subdirectory of the file system shown in Figure 4.6, the walk would yield
#  ( /user/rt/courses/cs016 , [ homeworks , programs ], [ grades ]).
#  Give your own implementation of such a walk function.
