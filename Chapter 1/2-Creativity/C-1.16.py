# In our implementation of the scale function (page 25), the body of the loop
#  executes the command data[j] *= factor. We have discussed that numeric
#  types are immutable, and that use of the *= operator in this context causes
#  the creation of a new instance (not the mutation of an existing instance).
#  How is it still possible, then, that our implementation of scale changes the
#  actual parameter sent by the caller?

While numeric values in Python are immutable, the actual parameter sent by the caller is modified because the
list (as a mutable container) replaces element references, allowing changes to propagate.
