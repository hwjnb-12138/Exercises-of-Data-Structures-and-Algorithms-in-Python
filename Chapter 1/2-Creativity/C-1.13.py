# Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n
#  integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they
#  were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
#  for doing the same thing.

1. Create a new list ln
2. Use ln.append() to add elements from the previous list in reverse order

reverse() is more efficient, but this method could reserve the previous list
